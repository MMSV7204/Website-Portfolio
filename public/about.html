<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in Miami, Florida. The daughter of blue collar middle Americans. My parents allways
  did their best to put food on the table and provide what they could for us. The lessons of finding ourselves was always an important on from my parents.
  My parents always stood behind me as I was drawn to the arts.

<p>I graduated from Florida Atlantic University with a BFA in Printmaking. i worked as a letterpress Printer and 
  screenprinter for several years in Miami at the IS Projects. During Covid my husband got an amzing job which took us to South Carolina.
  In the small town there were not many job oppurtunities for a printer, especially at the tail end of a global pandemic.
  So I transisitioned to an educator. I worked at a middle school teaching art to 6,7,& 8th graders for three years. The three hardest years of my life.
  Teaching children at this time was such a challenge with the age of technolgy we were thrown into and the political climate.
  I knew that teaching was not fullfilling my day to day, and I decided to shift again. This time to something I 
  had been intrusted in learning for sometime. That was webdesign. I started learning coding at the very beginning of my career.
  I found it to be completley captivating. I loved that it is art mixed with complex puzzles.

<p>I am still currently living in South Carolina nestled between Hilton Head and Savannah. 
  I am spending my days in the low country with my husband, our beautiful daughter, and our 
  two sweet kitties. I look forward to growing my Webdesign career where ever the wind takes me.
